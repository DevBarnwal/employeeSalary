## ðŸ“ˆ Modeling Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
   - Correlation matrix
   - Visualizing feature distributions

3. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Hyperparameter tuning

4. **Evaluation**
   - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
   - RÂ² Score
